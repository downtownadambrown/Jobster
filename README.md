# Jobster

For the last 50 years in the Restaurant Service industry, hiring has remained relatively the same practice: you sort through a handful of applications that were filled out and left by people visiting your business in order to apply and put their name out there.  While this works relatively well, many managers are not so much inclined to want to read through hundreds of text documents that give little to no visibility into what the person is actually like, and if they have the intangible soft skills needed to succeed.

With the onset of mobile and 'swiping'-driven applications, the next best option to create the maximum level of engagement for the manager while sifting through profiles would be a digital one.  

Jobster is an application designed to take the hassle out of scheduling interviews with prospective candidates.  Managers can click through a set of prospective hires that are actively on the market and seeking a position that meets many of their criteria.  This zero-hassle approach connects managers directly and quickly so that they can fill their job before the week is over.
